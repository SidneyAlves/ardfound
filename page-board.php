				<h2>DOCTOR RENIER BRENTJENS</h2>
                <p>With a PhD in microbiology from SUNY Buffalo, Dr. Renier Brentjens is an associate member
				of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and an assistant physician for their
				leukemia services. He initiated preclinical studies demonstrating the potential clinical application
				of genetically modified T cells to target the CD19 antigen by retroviral transfer of genes from
				artificial T cell receptors, the famous chimeric antigen (CAR) receptors. Dr. Brentjens has
				successfully applied these studies into the clinical setting by treating patients with chronic
				lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). His current pre-

				clinical research in progress is focused on the development of CAR-modified T cells designed to
				overcome the hostile immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through the generation of
				&quot;CAR armored T cells.&quot; The work at Dr. Brentjens’ laboratory expanded this CAR technology to
				target additional tumor antigens expressed in other tumors, including the MUC-16 antigen target
				expressed in ovarian carcinomas, as well as the more ubiquitous WT-1 tumor associated antigen.
				These latter projects are also in the process of being transitioned into the clinical environment.</p>

				<h2>DOCTOR GEOPOLIANO CHAVES</h2>
                <p>Doctor Gepoliano Chaves obtained a bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry from the Federal
				University of Viçosa (MG) by studying the effects of polyphenols on enzymes in the model of
				kidneys of mice with atherosclerosis (2012) at the Biotechnology Laboratory of Dr. Nader
				Pourmand, UC Santa Cruz. He then went on to earn his Master’s degree from the University of
				São Paulo while studying Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. His interest
				in how proteins are detected in biological samples motivated him to join the Pourmand
				Laboratory in 2014, participating in a project involving nanopipettes and next-generation
				sequencing. Since then, he has analyzed transcriptomic data in Huntingtons disease models, a
				neurodegenerative disorder. His dissertation work involves the use of nanopipettes to mitigate
				the nonspecific effects of the gene-editing technology by CRISPR / Cas9 and the underlying
				genetic analysis.</p>
